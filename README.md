This is a quick project that I had fun building but I might back out and not work on this as much
as I have found some things I think i could have done better but it may be to late and to much work and
I dont feel up to that.

This project was just meant to to test out electron and ws (websocket) and i think i learned a good amount form this.

For a bit I was think of making this full featured and suff but I think I was way over my head and I have to chill.

I was also planing on compiling them down to exe to run but again im not finished with this and I dont think i will ever or not in a long time, as one person working on this... But i had fun :)
